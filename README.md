# odin-flexbox-final
This is my attempt at Odin css final flex box landing page.

This exercies was to learn the use of flex box in laying out a website in a clean and orderly manner. It allowed me to parctice aligning items and justifying their content according to the requirements of the page. 

There are a number of distinct sections all of which are clear, easy to read, entertaining and intuative for the user which was the over all aim of this landing page.
